#2.3 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using raw_input to compute gross pay. 
#Use 35 hours and a rate of 2.75 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 96.25).
#You should use raw_input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking or 
#bad user data.



hrs = raw_input("Enter Hours:")
rate=raw_input("Enter Rate:")
pay=int(hrs)*float(rate)

print pay
